This repository contains a few R resources I am developing for working through the Andrew Ng's highly-recommended Machine Learning class, which is freely available online through Stanford Engineering Everywhere at http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseInfo.aspx?coll=348ca38a-3a6d-4052-937d-cb017338d7b1

If I've counted correctly, there are four programming exercises in the course problem sets. However, the "accessory" files for each exercise (setup files, data, plotting routines) are provided only in Matlab format.

I am attempting to kill two birds with one stone, learning R by loosely translating the accessory files to R.

Of course, because I'm learning both R and the course material, I can hardly guarantee that this material is of professional quality. However, I hope someone might find it useful.

Problem files are in directories like this:

 ps1p2/
   contains problem setup files translated from Matlab, but no solution
 ps1p2_solution/
   Also contains my solution.
   
Buyer beware. Note that in the course of the solution, I might decide to modify the setup files, and I don't guarantee that I'll update the original folder with my changes. I also don't guarantee that the files support doing the problem *exactly* as described in the problem sets. I might find some variant of the problem is more instructive.
